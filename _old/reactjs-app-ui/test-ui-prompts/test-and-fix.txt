always start apps and run tests with scripts in local-scripts
always include puppeteer or similar tool to ensure you detect client side redndered content to see content and errors. Additionally to curl or any other tools
make sure you can see the content of the equivalent of browser dev conole to see all errors returned client side
then do what is necessary jumpging though different apps.

You can figure out what apps need to work together and what you need to tests
lokning at script start-full-stack-react.sh

when testing requests to app set time limit to 30s else you will freeze ThemeProvider
try to implemente metrics in golang to trace what takes time

you must always confirm if something works using pupetter when it is http call and review of browser console error not just curl. And check browser console errors to trobleshoot and fix dependncies fom bottom to top.
