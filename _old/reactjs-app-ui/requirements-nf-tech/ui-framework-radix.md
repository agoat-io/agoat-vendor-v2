# Non-Functional Requirement: UI Framework Architecture - Radix UI with Radix Themes

## Requirement Identifier
NFR-UI-001

## Classification
User Interface Standards / Development Architecture

## Priority Level
Critical

## Executive Summary
The public viewer application shall implement Radix UI as the foundational component library and leverage Radix Themes for comprehensive styling orchestration. This architectural decision aims to eliminate style verbosity through preconfigured design tokens and component wrappers, thereby enhancing development efficiency and ensuring design consistency.

## Detailed Specification
The application's user interface shall be constructed utilizing Radix UI primitives as the underlying component foundation, with Radix Themes serving as the styling abstraction layer. This approach mandates the utilization of Radix Themes wrapper components to encapsulate styling logic, thereby obviating the need for extensive custom CSS implementations.

**Critical Implementation Mandate**: The application shall primarily utilize Radix Themes' out-of-the-box preconfigured theme combinations and design tokens as the foundation.
