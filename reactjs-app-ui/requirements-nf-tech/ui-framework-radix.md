# Non-Functional Requirement: UI Framework Architecture - Radix UI with Radix Themes

## Requirement Identifier
NFR-UI-001

## Classification
User Interface Standards / Development Architecture

## Priority Level
Critical

## Executive Summary
The public viewer application shall implement Radix UI as the foundational component library and leverage Radix Themes for comprehensive styling orchestration. This architectural decision aims to eliminate style verbosity through preconfigured design tokens and component wrappers, thereby enhancing development efficiency and ensuring design consistency.

## Detailed Specification
The application's user interface shall be constructed utilizing Radix UI primitives as the underlying component foundation, with Radix Themes serving as the styling abstraction layer. This approach mandates the utilization of Radix Themes wrapper components to encapsulate styling logic, thereby obviating the need for extensive custom CSS implementations.

**Critical Implementation Mandate**: The application shall exclusively utilize Radix Themes' out-of-the-box preconfigured theme combinations and design tokens. Custom theme creation shall be strictly prohibited in favor of leveraging Radix Themes' built-in theme variants, color palettes, spacing scales, typography systems, and border radius configurations.

## Business Justification
- **Design Consistency**: Radix UI delivers accessible, unstyled primitives that guarantee uniform behavioral patterns across the application ecosystem
- **Code Maintainability**: Radix Themes provides a comprehensive design system that substantially reduces custom CSS overhead and minimizes style complexity
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Radix UI components incorporate built-in accessibility features, eliminating the necessity for custom accessibility implementations
- **Development Velocity**: Radix Themes wrapper components offer production-ready styled elements, accelerating feature development cycles
- **Design System Integration**: Centralized theming capabilities ensure cohesive visual identity across all application interfaces
- **Vendor Reliability**: Leveraging Radix Themes' out-of-the-box configurations ensures long-term maintainability and reduces vendor lock-in risks

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All user interface components must be constructed using Radix UI primitive components
2. Component styling must be implemented exclusively through Radix Themes wrapper components
3. Custom CSS implementations shall be restricted to application-specific styling requirements not addressed by Radix Themes
4. All components must maintain accessibility compliance standards as defined by Radix UI specifications
5. The application must implement a unified theme configuration utilizing Radix Themes design tokens
6. Component styling must be responsive and adapt to various viewport dimensions
7. Theme switching capabilities must be supported through Radix Themes configuration
8. **All theming shall utilize Radix Themes' out-of-the-box preconfigured theme combinations**
9. **No custom theme creation shall be permitted; only Radix Themes' built-in theme variants shall be employed**
10. **Theme switching shall be implemented using Radix Themes' native theme configuration options**

## Implementation Standards
- Utilize `@radix-ui/react-*` packages for all component primitives
- Implement `@radix-ui/themes` for comprehensive styling and theming orchestration
- Employ Radix Themes wrapper components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Text`, `Container`) in lieu of custom style implementations
- Configure design tokens through Radix Themes ThemeProvider component
- Abstain from inline styling in favor of Radix Themes predefined styling configurations
- Implement responsive design patterns through Radix Themes responsive utilities
- Establish consistent spacing and typography scales using Radix Themes design tokens
- **Exclusively utilize Radix Themes' built-in theme combinations and design tokens**
- **Implement theme switching using Radix Themes' native appearance, accent color, gray color, radius, and scaling options**
- **Leverage Radix Themes' preconfigured color palettes, spacing scales, and typography systems**

## Technical Dependencies
- `@radix-ui/react-*` component primitive packages
- `@radix-ui/themes` styling and theming framework
- Theme configuration infrastructure
- Responsive design utilities
- Design token management system
- **Radix Themes' out-of-the-box preconfigured theme combinations**

## Architectural Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing application architecture and component patterns
- Shall not introduce significant bundle size overhead that impacts application performance
- Must support comprehensive responsive design requirements across all device categories
- Shall maintain backward compatibility with existing component interfaces
- Must integrate seamlessly with current state management and routing systems
- **Shall not create custom themes; must use Radix Themes' built-in theme configurations exclusively**
- **Must leverage Radix Themes' native theme switching capabilities**

## Performance Objectives
- Achieve a minimum 60% reduction in custom CSS implementation
- Maintain or improve application bundle size efficiency
- Ensure sub-100ms component rendering performance
- Optimize theme switching performance to under 50ms
- **Leverage Radix Themes' optimized CSS variable system for instant theme switching**

## Quality Assurance Metrics
- **Code Quality**: Reduction in custom CSS by minimum 60%
- **Design Consistency**: 100% component styling consistency across application
- **Accessibility**: Maintain or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards
- **Development Efficiency**: 40% reduction in component development time
- **Maintainability**: 50% reduction in style-related technical debt
- **Theme Compliance**: 100% utilization of Radix Themes' out-of-the-box configurations

## Risk Mitigation
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Implement abstraction layer for potential framework migration
- **Performance Impact**: Conduct bundle size analysis and optimization
- **Learning Curve**: Provide comprehensive documentation and training resources
- **Customization Limitations**: Establish clear boundaries for custom styling requirements
- **Theme Maintenance**: Rely on Radix Themes' maintained and tested theme configurations

## Radix Themes Out-of-the-Box Requirements
### Mandatory Theme Utilization
- **Appearance Modes**: Utilize Radix Themes' built-in light and dark appearance variants
- **Accent Colors**: Employ Radix Themes' predefined accent color palette (blue, green, red, yellow, purple, orange, pink, gray)
- **Gray Colors**: Use Radix Themes' built-in gray color schemes (gray, mauve, slate, sage, olive, sand)
- **Border Radius**: Implement Radix Themes' standardized radius options (none, small, medium, large, full)
- **Scaling**: Leverage Radix Themes' scaling configurations (90%, 95%, 100%, 105%, 110%)
- **Design Tokens**: Utilize Radix Themes' CSS variable system for all styling requirements

### Preconfigured Theme Combinations
The application shall implement and utilize the following Radix Themes preconfigured combinations:
- **Modern Professional**: Blue accent with slate grays, medium radius
- **Warm & Friendly**: Orange accent with sand grays, large radius
- **Minimal & Clean**: Gray accent with gray grays, small radius
- **Vibrant & Energetic**: Purple accent with mauve grays, large radius
