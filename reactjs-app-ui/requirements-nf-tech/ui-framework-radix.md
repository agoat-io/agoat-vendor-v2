# Non-Functional Requirement: UI Framework Architecture - Radix UI with Radix Themes

## Requirement Identifier
NFR-UI-001

## Classification
User Interface Standards / Development Architecture

## Priority Level
Critical

## Executive Summary
The public viewer application shall implement Radix UI as the foundational component library and leverage Radix Themes for comprehensive styling orchestration. This architectural decision aims to eliminate style verbosity through preconfigured design tokens and component wrappers, thereby enhancing development efficiency and ensuring design consistency.

## Detailed Specification
The application's user interface shall be constructed utilizing Radix UI primitives as the underlying component foundation, with Radix Themes serving as the styling abstraction layer. This approach mandates the utilization of Radix Themes wrapper components to encapsulate styling logic, thereby obviating the need for extensive custom CSS implementations.

**Critical Implementation Mandate**: The application shall primarily utilize Radix Themes' out-of-the-box preconfigured theme combinations and design tokens as the foundation. The system architecture shall be designed to enable seamless extension capabilities for custom theme combinations while maintaining the integrity and consistency of Radix Themes' design system principles.

## Business Justification
- **Design Consistency**: Radix UI delivers accessible, unstyled primitives that guarantee uniform behavioral patterns across the application ecosystem
- **Code Maintainability**: Radix Themes provides a comprehensive design system that substantially reduces custom CSS overhead and minimizes style complexity
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Radix UI components incorporate built-in accessibility features, eliminating the necessity for custom accessibility implementations
- **Development Velocity**: Radix Themes wrapper components offer production-ready styled elements, accelerating feature development cycles
- **Design System Integration**: Centralized theming capabilities ensure cohesive visual identity across all application interfaces
- **Vendor Reliability**: Leveraging Radix Themes' out-of-the-box configurations ensures long-term maintainability and reduces vendor lock-in risks
- **Extensibility**: Architecture designed to support custom theme combinations while maintaining Radix Themes' design principles
