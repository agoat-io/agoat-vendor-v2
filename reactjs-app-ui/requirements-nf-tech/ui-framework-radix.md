# Non-Functional Requirement: UI Framework Architecture - Radix UI with Radix Themes

## Requirement Identifier
NFR-UI-001

## Classification
User Interface Standards / Development Architecture

## Priority Level
Critical

## Executive Summary
The public viewer application shall implement Radix UI as the foundational component library and leverage Radix Themes for comprehensive styling orchestration. This architectural decision aims to eliminate style verbosity through preconfigured design tokens and component wrappers, thereby enhancing development efficiency and ensuring design consistency.

## Detailed Specification
The application's user interface shall be constructed utilizing Radix UI primitives as the underlying component foundation, with Radix Themes serving as the styling abstraction layer. This approach mandates the utilization of Radix Themes wrapper components to encapsulate styling logic, thereby obviating the need for extensive custom CSS implementations.

## Business Justification
- **Design Consistency**: Radix UI delivers accessible, unstyled primitives that guarantee uniform behavioral patterns across the application ecosystem
- **Code Maintainability**: Radix Themes provides a comprehensive design system that substantially reduces custom CSS overhead and minimizes style complexity
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Radix UI components incorporate built-in accessibility features, eliminating the necessity for custom accessibility implementations
- **Development Velocity**: Radix Themes wrapper components offer production-ready styled elements, accelerating feature development cycles
- **Design System Integration**: Centralized theming capabilities ensure cohesive visual identity across all application interfaces

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All user interface components must be constructed using Radix UI primitive components
2. Component styling must be implemented exclusively through Radix Themes wrapper components
3. Custom CSS implementations shall be restricted to application-specific styling requirements not addressed by Radix Themes
4. All components must maintain accessibility compliance standards as defined by Radix UI specifications
5. The application must implement a unified theme configuration utilizing Radix Themes design tokens
6. Component styling must be responsive and adapt to various viewport dimensions
7. Theme switching capabilities must be supported through Radix Themes configuration

## Implementation Standards
- Utilize `@radix-ui/react-*` packages for all component primitives
- Implement `@radix-ui/themes` for comprehensive styling and theming orchestration
- Employ Radix Themes wrapper components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Text`, `Container`) in lieu of custom style implementations
- Configure design tokens through Radix Themes ThemeProvider component
- Abstain from inline styling in favor of Radix Themes predefined styling configurations
- Implement responsive design patterns through Radix Themes responsive utilities
- Establish consistent spacing and typography scales using Radix Themes design tokens

## Technical Dependencies
- `@radix-ui/react-*` component primitive packages
- `@radix-ui/themes` styling and theming framework
- Theme configuration infrastructure
- Responsive design utilities
- Design token management system

## Architectural Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing application architecture and component patterns
- Shall not introduce significant bundle size overhead that impacts application performance
- Must support comprehensive responsive design requirements across all device categories
- Shall maintain backward compatibility with existing component interfaces
- Must integrate seamlessly with current state management and routing systems

## Performance Objectives
- Achieve a minimum 60% reduction in custom CSS implementation
- Maintain or improve application bundle size efficiency
- Ensure sub-100ms component rendering performance
- Optimize theme switching performance to under 50ms

## Quality Assurance Metrics
- **Code Quality**: Reduction in custom CSS by minimum 60%
- **Design Consistency**: 100% component styling consistency across application
- **Accessibility**: Maintain or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards
- **Development Efficiency**: 40% reduction in component development time
- **Maintainability**: 50% reduction in style-related technical debt

## Risk Mitigation
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Implement abstraction layer for potential framework migration
- **Performance Impact**: Conduct bundle size analysis and optimization
- **Learning Curve**: Provide comprehensive documentation and training resources
- **Customization Limitations**: Establish clear boundaries for custom styling requirements

## Related Requirements
- Accessibility compliance requirements (NFR-ACC-001)
- Performance optimization requirements (NFR-PERF-001)
- Code maintainability standards (NFR-MAIN-001)
- Design system governance (NFR-DESIGN-001)
