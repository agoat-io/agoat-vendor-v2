# EditPost Save Functionality Fix

**Date:** 2025-09-30 22:18:00  
**Change Type:** Bug Fix  
**Scope:** EditPost Page Save Functionality  

## Summary

Fixed the EditPost page save functionality by updating it to use the new WysimarkEditor interface. The EditPost component was still using the old interface with `onPublish` prop and `isDraft` parameter, which was causing save failures after the WysimarkEditor refactor.

## Problem Identified

The EditPost component was not updated when the WysimarkEditor interface was changed. This caused:

1. **Interface Mismatch**: EditPost was passing `onPublish` prop to WysimarkEditor, but WysimarkEditor no longer accepts this prop
2. **Parameter Mismatch**: EditPost's `handleSave` function was using `isDraft` parameter, but WysimarkEditor now passes `status` parameter
3. **Missing Status Management**: EditPost had no status management for the new status-based workflow

## Changes Made

### 1. EditPost Component (`src/pages/EditPost.tsx`)

**Function Updates:**
- Updated `handleSave` function signature from `(content: string, title: string, isDraft: boolean)` to `(content: string, title: string, status: string)`
- Updated API call to use `published: status === 'published'` and `status: status`
- Removed `handlePublish` function entirely (no longer needed)
- Added `handleStatusChange` function to manage status changes

**Props Updates:**
- Removed `onPublish` prop from WysimarkEditor call
- Added `status={post.status}` prop to pass current post status
- Added `onStatusChange={handleStatusChange}` prop for status change handling

**API Integration:**
- Updated PUT request to include both `published` and `status` fields
- Maintained proper error handling and response processing

## Technical Details

### Before Fix
```typescript
// Old interface - caused errors
const handleSave = async (content: string, title: string, isDraft: boolean) => {
  const response = await apiClient.put(url, {
    title,
    content,
    published: !isDraft  // Only published field
  })
}

<WysimarkEditor
  onSave={handleSave}
  onPublish={handlePublish}  // This prop no longer exists
/>
```

### After Fix
```typescript
// New interface - works correctly
const handleSave = async (content: string, title: string, status: string) => {
  const response = await apiClient.put(url, {
    title,
    content,
    published: status === 'published',  // Based on status
    status: status  // Include status field
  })
}

<WysimarkEditor
  onSave={handleSave}
  status={post.status}  // Pass current status
  onStatusChange={handleStatusChange}  // Handle status changes
/>
```
