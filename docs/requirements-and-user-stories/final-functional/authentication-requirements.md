# Authentication Requirements

## Overview
This document defines the functional requirements for authentication in the AGoat Publisher system, including OIDC-compliant authentication, multiple provider support, and state preservation.

## Functional Requirements

### **REQ-AUTH-001: OIDC-Compliant Authentication**
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Authentication  
**Description**: The system shall support OIDC-compliant authentication with any OIDC provider.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System supports standard OIDC claims (sub, iss, aud, email, etc.)
- System supports OIDC discovery endpoint for automatic configuration
- System implements PKCE for enhanced security
- System supports state parameters for CSRF protection
- System works with any OIDC-compliant provider (Cognito, Azure AD, Auth0, Google, etc.)

**User Stories**:
- **As a user**, I want to authenticate using my organization's identity provider, so that I can access the system with my existing credentials.
- **As a system administrator**, I want to configure multiple OIDC providers, so that different user groups can use their preferred authentication method.

### **REQ-AUTH-002: Multiple Provider Support**
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Authentication  
**Description**: The system shall support multiple instances of the same provider type for different environments or tenants.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System can handle multiple Cognito User Pools
- System can handle multiple Azure Tenants
- System can handle multiple Auth0 applications
- Each provider instance is uniquely identified by JWT token issuer
- System can route authentication to correct provider instance based on JWT token
- Provider instances can be associated with environment context (production, staging, development)

**User Stories**:
- **As a system administrator**, I want to configure separate authentication providers for different environments, so that development and production users are isolated.
- **As a multi-tenant organization**, I want to use different Azure tenants for different business units, so that user access is properly segregated.

### **REQ-AUTH-003: State Preservation**
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Authentication  
**Description**: The system shall preserve user state during authentication flow, returning users to their original page after login.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User clicks login from any page
- User is redirected to provider's managed login UI
- After successful authentication, user returns to original page
- Page state is preserved (URL, query parameters, hash)
- Security validation prevents open redirects
- Fallback to default page if return URL is invalid

**User Stories**:
- **As a user**, I want to be redirected back to the page I was on before logging in, so that I can continue my workflow seamlessly after authentication.
- **As a user**, I want my current page state preserved during login, so that I don't lose my place in the application.

### **REQ-AUTH-004: Token Management**
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Authentication  
**Description**: The system shall securely manage OIDC tokens with automatic refresh and validation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System stores tokens securely (hashed, never plain text)
- System automatically refreshes tokens before expiration
- System validates tokens using JWKS endpoints
- System supports access, refresh, and ID tokens
- System handles token expiration gracefully
- System logs token events for audit purposes

**User Stories**:
- **As a user**, I want my session to remain active without manual re-authentication, so that I can work uninterrupted.
- **As a system administrator**, I want to monitor token usage and refresh patterns, so that I can ensure system security.

### **REQ-AUTH-005: Session Management**
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Authentication  
**Description**: The system shall manage user sessions with proper security and cleanup.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System creates secure sessions with unique identifiers
- System supports session timeout and cleanup
- System handles concurrent sessions appropriately
- System provides session invalidation on logout
- System logs session events for audit purposes

**User Stories**:
- **As a user**, I want to be able to log out securely, so that my session is properly terminated.
- **As a system administrator**, I want to monitor active sessions, so that I can ensure proper security.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### **REQ-AUTH-NF-001: Security**
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Security  
**Description**: Authentication system shall meet enterprise security standards.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All tokens are hashed before storage
- Client secrets are encrypted
- PKCE is implemented for all OAuth2 flows
- State parameters prevent CSRF attacks
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Audit logging captures all authentication events

### **REQ-AUTH-NF-002: Performance**
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Performance  
**Description**: Authentication system shall perform efficiently under load.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Token validation completes within 100ms
- Authentication flow completes within 2 seconds
- System supports 1000 concurrent authentication requests
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexes

### **REQ-AUTH-NF-003: Availability**
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Reliability  
**Description**: Authentication system shall be highly available.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System maintains 99.9% uptime
- Multiple provider instances provide redundancy
- Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable
- Automatic failover between provider instances

### **REQ-AUTH-NF-004: Scalability**
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Scalability  
**Description**: Authentication system shall scale with user growth.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System supports 10,000+ concurrent users
- Database schema supports horizontal scaling
- Provider instances can be added without downtime
- Token storage scales with user base

## Dependencies

### **Internal Dependencies**:
- Database schema for user and session management
- Frontend authentication components
- Backend authentication handlers
- Configuration management system

### **External Dependencies**:
- OIDC-compliant identity providers
- JWKS endpoints for token validation
- Network connectivity to provider endpoints

## Assumptions

1. Users have access to OIDC-compliant identity providers
2. Network connectivity is available to provider endpoints
3. Providers support standard OIDC claims and endpoints
4. Users are familiar with their organization's authentication flow

## Constraints

1. Must comply with OIDC specification
2. Must support existing user base during migration
3. Must maintain backward compatibility where possible
4. Must meet enterprise security requirements
5. Must support multi-tenant architecture

## Success Criteria

1. Users can authenticate using any OIDC-compliant provider
2. Multiple provider instances work correctly
3. State preservation works for all authentication flows
4. Token management is secure and efficient
5. System meets all security and performance requirements
6. Authentication system is highly available and scalable
