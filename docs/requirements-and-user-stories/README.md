# Requirements Documentation

This folder contains all requirements documentation for the AGoat Publisher system, organized according to the global instructions.

## Folder Structure

### `/final-functional/`
Contains **functional requirements** - what the system shall do:
- `authentication-requirements.md` - Authentication system requirements
- `database-requirements.md` - Database system requirements
- Additional functional requirement documents as needed

### `/final-nonfunctional/`
Contains **non-functional requirements** - how well the system shall perform:
- `performance-requirements.md` - Performance and scalability requirements
- `security-requirements.md` - Security and compliance requirements
- `reliability-requirements.md` - Availability and reliability requirements
- Additional non-functional requirement documents as needed

### `/requirement-change-history/`
Contains change logs for all requirement modifications:
- Files named with format: `YYYY-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss-requirement-request.md`
- Each change request documented in its own file
- Summarizes what was requested and what was implemented

### `/templates/`
Contains templates for consistent requirements documentation:
- `functional-requirement-template.md` - Template for functional requirements
- `nonfunctional-requirement-template.md` - Template for non-functional requirements
- `user-story-template.md` - Template for user stories

## Content Guidelines

## Requirements Standards

### Functional Requirements
- Must be testable and verifiable
- Must specify what the system shall do
- Must include acceptance criteria
- Must be written from user perspective
- Must be implementation-independent

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Must be measurable and quantifiable
- Must specify performance targets
- Must include measurement criteria
- Must be testable through metrics
- Must be technology-independent

### User Stories
- Must follow "As a... I want... So that..." format
- Must include acceptance criteria
- Must be user-focused
- Must be testable
- Must be small enough to implement in one sprint

## Change Management

All requirement changes must be documented in the change history with:
- Date and time of change request
- Summary of what was requested
- Summary of what was implemented
- Impact on existing requirements
- Approval and review information

## Templates

Use the provided templates for consistent documentation:
1. Copy the appropriate template
2. Fill in all required sections
3. Follow the template structure
4. Include all acceptance criteria
5. Get appropriate approvals

## Quality Assurance

All requirements must be:
- **Clear**: Unambiguous and easy to understand
- **Complete**: All necessary information included
- **Consistent**: Aligned with other requirements
- **Testable**: Can be verified through testing
- **Traceable**: Linked to business objectives
- **Feasible**: Can be implemented within constraints
