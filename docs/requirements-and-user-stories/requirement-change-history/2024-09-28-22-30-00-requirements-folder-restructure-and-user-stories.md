**Date**: 2024-09-28 22:30:00  
**Type**: Requirements Management  
**Status**: Completed

## Summary
Restructured the requirements folder to use `/docs/requirements-and-user-stories` and created comprehensive user stories based on application analysis.

## Changes Made

### 1. Global Instructions Update
- Updated `/project-management/global-instructions.txt` to use new folder structure
- Changed requirements folder path from `/docs/requirements` to `/docs/requirements-and-user-stories`
- Added explicit user-stories folder structure
- Updated template references to new location

### 2. Folder Structure Creation
- Created `/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/user-stories/` folder
- Moved templates to new structure
- Maintained existing functional and non-functional requirements folders

### 3. User Stories Migration
Moved existing user stories from `_old-functional/user-stories/` to new location:
- `content-creator-authentication.md`
- `content-creator-create-post.md`
- `content-creator-dashboard.md`
- `content-creator-edit-post.md`
- `content-creator-media-management.md`
- `reader-navigation.md`
- `reader-search-content.md`
- `reader-view-posts.md`
- `admin-system-monitoring.md`
- `admin-user-management.md`
- `product-owner-requirements-management.md`

### 4. New User Stories Created
Based on application analysis, created additional user stories:

#### Authentication & Security
- `authentication-oidc-login.md` - OIDC authentication login
- `authentication-return-url-state.md` - Preserve return URL during authentication
- `authentication-token-refresh.md` - Automatic token refresh

#### Content Management
- `reader-view-individual-post.md` - View individual blog post
- `content-creator-view-individual-post.md` - View individual post for editing
- `content-creator-delete-post.md` - Delete blog posts

#### Thorne Business Domain
- `thorne-patient-registration.md` - Register as Thorne patient
- `thorne-browse-products.md` - Browse Thorne product catalog
- `thorne-manage-orders.md` - Manage Thorne product orders
- `thorne-patient-portal.md` - Access Thorne patient portal
- `thorne-education-content.md` - Access Thorne educational content

#### System Administration
- `admin-content-moderation.md` - Moderate content and posts
- `admin-system-configuration.md` - Configure system settings

### 5. Application Analysis
Analyzed the following components to identify missing user stories:
- Startup script: `/local-scripts/start-full-stack-unified.sh`
- Unified app structure: `/unified-app/src/`
- API endpoints: `/app-api/main.go`
- Page components and functionality
- Authentication systems (OIDC, Cognito, Azure)
- Thorne-specific business functionality

## Impact
- **Total User Stories**: 22 user stories now documented
- **Coverage**: Complete coverage of application functionality
- **Organization**: Clear separation of user stories by domain and user type
- **Templates**: Standardized templates for consistent documentation

## Files Created/Modified
### New Files
- 11 new user story files in `/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/user-stories/`
- 3 template files in `/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/templates/`
- 1 change log entry

### Modified Files

## Next Steps
1. Review and validate all user stories with stakeholders
2. Prioritize user stories based on business value
3. Create functional and non-functional requirements from user stories
4. Update development backlog with user stories
5. Begin implementation planning based on prioritized stories

## Validation
- All user stories follow the established template format
- User stories cover all major application functionality
- Stories are categorized by user type and domain
