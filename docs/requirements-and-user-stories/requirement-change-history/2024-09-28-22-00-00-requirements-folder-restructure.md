# Requirements Folder Restructure - Change Log

**Date**: 2024-09-28  
**Time**: 22:00:00 UTC  
**Change Request**: Following requirements `/projects/agoat-publisher/project-management/global-instructions.txt`, ensure that requirement folders actually have only use cases and requirements and that functional and non-functional are correctly categorized. If other types of content need to be in other folders then use different existing or new folders that make sense and update instructions.

## Summary of Changes

### **Problem Identified**
The requirements folders contained technical implementation documents instead of pure requirements, violating the global instructions that requirements folders should contain only use cases and requirements.

### **Solution Implemented**
Restructured the documentation to properly separate requirements from technical implementation details, creating appropriate folder structures and updating global instructions.

## Files Created/Modified

### **New Folder Structure Created**
- **`/docs/technical-implementation/`** - New folder for technical implementation details
  - **`/authentication/`** - Authentication system implementation
  - **`/database/`** - Database implementation details  
  - **`/features/`** - Feature implementation details
  - **`/api/`** - API implementation details (ready for future use)

### **Requirements Documents Created**
- **`/docs/requirements/final-functional/authentication-requirements.md`** - Pure functional requirements for authentication
- **`/docs/requirements/final-functional/database-requirements.md`** - Pure functional requirements for database
- **`/docs/requirements/final-nonfunctional/performance-requirements.md`** - Performance and scalability requirements
- **`/docs/requirements/final-nonfunctional/security-requirements.md`** - Security and compliance requirements
- **`/docs/requirements/final-nonfunctional/reliability-requirements.md`** - Availability and reliability requirements

### **Templates Created**
- **`/docs/requirements/templates/functional-requirement-template.md`** - Template for functional requirements
- **`/docs/requirements/templates/nonfunctional-requirement-template.md`** - Template for non-functional requirements
- **`/docs/requirements/templates/user-story-template.md`** - Template for user stories

### **Documentation Created**
- **`/docs/requirements/README.md`** - Requirements folder documentation and guidelines
- **`/docs/technical-implementation/README.md`** - Technical implementation folder documentation

### **Files Moved**
- **`oidc-agnostic-ciam.md`** → `/docs/technical-implementation/authentication/`
- **`multiple-providers-same-type.md`** → `/docs/technical-implementation/authentication/`
- **`database-schema-analysis.md`** → `/docs/technical-implementation/database/`
- **`cognito-return-url-state.md`** → `/docs/technical-implementation/features/`

### **Global Instructions Updated**
- **`/project-management/global-instructions.txt`** - Updated to reflect new folder structure and content guidelines

## Content Separation

### **Requirements Folders Now Contain ONLY:**
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system shall do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: How well the system shall perform  
- **User Stories**: User-focused requirements in "As a... I want... So that..." format
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable conditions for requirements

### **Technical Implementation Folders Now Contain:**
- **Architecture Details**: System architecture and design
- **Implementation Specifications**: How features are implemented
- **Code Examples**: Relevant code snippets and examples
- **Database Schemas**: Database design and schema details
- **API Specifications**: API endpoints and specifications
- **Configuration Details**: System configuration and setup

## Requirements Extracted

### **Authentication Requirements (REQ-AUTH-001 to REQ-AUTH-005)**
- OIDC-Compliant Authentication
- Multiple Provider Support
- State Preservation
- Token Management
- Session Management

### **Database Requirements (REQ-DB-001 to REQ-DB-006)**
- Multitenant Architecture
- User Management
- Content Management
- CIAM Integration
- Data Integrity
- Migration Support

### **Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, scalability
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Reliability**: Availability, fault tolerance, disaster recovery

## Quality Improvements

### **Requirements Quality**
- All requirements are now testable and verifiable
- Clear acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Proper categorization between functional and non-functional
- User stories follow standard format
- Requirements are implementation-independent

### **Documentation Quality**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent structure and formatting
- Comprehensive templates for future use
- Proper documentation guidelines
- Updated global instructions

## Compliance with Global Instructions

✅ **Functional and non-functional requirements are correctly categorized**  
✅ **Technical implementation details moved to appropriate folders**  
✅ **Global instructions updated to reflect new structure**  
✅ **Templates created for consistent documentation**  
✅ **Documentation guidelines established**  

## Benefits Achieved

### **1. Clear Separation of Concerns**
- Requirements are now pure business requirements
- Technical implementation is properly documented separately
- No mixing of requirements and implementation details

### **2. Improved Requirements Quality**
- All requirements are testable and verifiable
- Clear acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Proper categorization and organization
- Consistent structure and formatting

### **3. Better Documentation Organization**
- Logical folder structure for different content types
- Clear guidelines for where content belongs
- Templates for consistent documentation
- Comprehensive documentation standards

### **4. Enhanced Maintainability**
- Easier to find and update requirements
- Clear guidelines for future documentation
- Consistent structure across all documents
- Proper version control and change tracking

## Future Considerations

### **Requirements Management**
- Use templates for all new requirements
- Follow established guidelines for content placement
- Maintain separation between requirements and implementation
- Regular review and validation of requirements

### **Documentation Maintenance**
- Keep requirements and implementation in sync
- Update documentation when requirements change
- Regular review of folder structure and guidelines
- Continuous improvement of documentation quality

## Success Criteria

✅ **Requirements folders contain only use cases and requirements**  
✅ **Functional and non-functional requirements are properly categorized**  
✅ **Technical implementation details are in appropriate folders**  
✅ **Global instructions reflect new structure**  
✅ **Templates are available for consistent documentation**  
✅ **Documentation guidelines are established**  
✅ **Content separation is clear and logical**  
✅ **Quality of requirements is improved**  

## Conclusion

The requirements folder restructure has been successfully completed, ensuring that requirements folders contain only use cases and requirements while technical implementation details are properly organized in separate folders. The global instructions have been updated to reflect the new structure, and comprehensive templates and guidelines have been established for future documentation.

The system now has a clear, logical, and maintainable documentation structure that properly separates business requirements from technical implementation details, improving the overall quality and usability of the documentation.
