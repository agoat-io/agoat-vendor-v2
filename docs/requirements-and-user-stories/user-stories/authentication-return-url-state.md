# Preserve Return URL During Authentication

**As a** User  
**I need to** return to the page I was originally trying to access after login  
**So that** I can continue my workflow without losing my place in the application

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] When I try to access a protected page without being logged in, I am redirected to login
- [ ] The system remembers the URL I was trying to access
- [ ] After successful authentication, I am redirected back to my original destination
- [ ] The return URL is preserved across the OIDC authentication flow
- [ ] I can navigate directly to any page and be redirected appropriately after login
- [ ] The system handles deep links and complex URLs correctly
- [ ] I can bookmark protected pages and access them after login
- [ ] The return URL is validated for security (same domain, allowed paths)
- [ ] I can cancel the login process and return to the original page
- [ ] The system works with multiple OIDC providers
- [ ] Return URL state is preserved even if the authentication takes time
- [ ] I can see where I will be redirected before completing login
