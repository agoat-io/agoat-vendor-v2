# Preserve Return URL During Authentication

**As a** User  
**I need to** return to the page I was originally trying to access after login  
**So that** I can continue my workflow without losing my place in the application

## Use Cases

### UC-AUTH-003: Return URL State Preservation
**Primary Actor**: User  
**Goal**: Return to original page after authentication  
**Preconditions**: User is not authenticated and tries to access protected content  
**Main Flow**:
1. User navigates to a protected page while not authenticated
2. System detects unauthenticated access attempt
3. System captures current page URL and state
4. System stores return URL securely in state parameter
5. System redirects user to authentication provider
6. User completes authentication with provider
7. Provider redirects user back to application with authorization code and state
8. System validates state parameter and extracts return URL
9. System exchanges authorization code for tokens
10. System redirects user to original return URL
11. User continues their workflow on the original page

**Alternative Flows**:
- 3a. User directly accesses login page: System uses default return URL
- 8a. State parameter is invalid: System redirects to default page
- 8b. Return URL is invalid/unsafe: System redirects to default page

**Postconditions**: User is authenticated and on their original intended page

### UC-AUTH-004: Deep Link Authentication
**Primary Actor**: User  
**Goal**: Access deep links after authentication  
**Preconditions**: User has a direct link to a protected page  
**Main Flow**:
1. User clicks on a deep link to a protected page
2. System detects unauthenticated access
3. System captures the deep link URL
4. System stores deep link in return URL state
5. System redirects user to authentication
6. User authenticates successfully
7. System redirects user to the deep link
8. User accesses the intended content

**Alternative Flows**:
- 7a. Deep link is no longer valid: System redirects to appropriate fallback page

**Postconditions**: User is authenticated and viewing the deep-linked content

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] When I try to access a protected page without being logged in, I am redirected to login
- [ ] The system remembers the URL I was trying to access
- [ ] After successful authentication, I am redirected back to my original destination
- [ ] The return URL is preserved across the OIDC authentication flow
- [ ] I can navigate directly to any page and be redirected appropriately after login
- [ ] The system handles deep links and complex URLs correctly

- [ ] I can cancel the login process and return to the original page
- [ ] The system works with multiple OIDC providers
- [ ] Return URL state is preserved even if the authentication takes time
- [ ] I can see where I will be redirected before completing login
