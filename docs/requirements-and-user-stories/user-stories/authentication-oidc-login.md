# OIDC Authentication Login

**As a** User  
**I need to** log in using OIDC-compliant identity providers  
**So that** I can securely access the publishing system with my preferred identity

## Use Cases

### UC-AUTH-001: User Login with OIDC Provider
**Primary Actor**: User  
**Goal**: Authenticate using OIDC-compliant identity provider  
**Preconditions**: User has access to an OIDC-compliant identity provider  
**Main Flow**:
1. User navigates to the application
2. User clicks on login button
3. System displays available OIDC providers
4. User selects their preferred provider
5. System redirects user to provider's managed login UI
6. User authenticates with provider
7. Provider redirects user back to application with authorization code
8. System exchanges authorization code for tokens
9. System establishes user session
10. User is redirected to their intended destination

**Alternative Flows**:
- 3a. No providers available: System displays error message
- 6a. Authentication fails: User is redirected back with error
- 8a. Token exchange fails: System displays error and allows retry

**Postconditions**: User is authenticated and has access to protected areas

### UC-AUTH-002: Multi-Provider Authentication
**Primary Actor**: User  
**Goal**: Choose from multiple available identity providers  
**Preconditions**: System is configured with multiple OIDC providers  
**Main Flow**:
1. User accesses login page
2. System displays list of available providers
3. User selects desired provider
4. System initiates authentication flow for selected provider
5. User completes authentication with chosen provider
6. System processes authentication result
7. User gains access to application

**Alternative Flows**:
- 2a. Only one provider available: System automatically redirects to that provider
- 4a. Provider is unavailable: System displays error and shows other options

**Postconditions**: User is authenticated using their chosen provider
