# Technical Implementation Documentation

This folder contains technical implementation details, architecture documentation, and design specifications for the AGoat Publisher system.

## Quick Start

For a high-level overview of the current implementation, start with:
- **[Implementation Summary](IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md)** - Current system overview and key file references

For detailed technical specifications, see the individual documentation files below.

### `/configuration/`
Contains configuration management details:
- `configuration-management.md` - Configuration files, environment variables, and secret management

### `/security/`
Contains security implementation details:
- `security-implementation.md` - Authentication, authorization, data protection, and security monitoring

### `/database/`

## Content Guidelines

### Technical Implementation Documents Should Contain:
- **Architecture Details**: System architecture and design patterns
- **Implementation Specifications**: How features are implemented (without large code blocks)
- **File References**: Specific file names and locations for relevant code
- **Small Code Snippets**: Only when necessary to understand implementation concepts
- **Database Schemas**: Database design and schema details
- **API Specifications**: API endpoints and specifications
- **Configuration Details**: System configuration and setup
- **Integration Details**: How components integrate
- **Technical Decisions**: Technical choices and rationale
- **Current Implementation Status**: What's implemented vs. planned

### Technical Implementation Documents Should NOT Contain:
- Large portions of code (reference file names instead)
- Pure requirements (use `/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/` instead)
- Business rules and user stories
- High-level business objectives
- Non-technical acceptance criteria
- Complete code implementations (use file references)

## Document Types

### Architecture Documents
- System architecture overview
- Component relationships
- Data flow diagrams
- Integration patterns
- Technology choices

### Implementation Guides
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Code examples and snippets
- Configuration procedures
- Setup and deployment guides
- Troubleshooting guides

### API Documentation
- Endpoint specifications
- Request/response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Error handling
- Rate limiting and quotas

### Database Documentation
- Schema design and rationale
- Table relationships
- Index strategies
- Migration procedures
- Performance considerations

## Quality Standards

All technical implementation documents should be:
- **Accurate**: Reflect actual implementation
- **Complete**: Include all necessary details
- **Current**: Updated with latest changes
- **Clear**: Easy to understand and follow
- **Consistent**: Follow established patterns
- **Testable**: Include verification steps

## Maintenance Process

### When to Update Technical Implementation Documentation:
- **New Features Added**: Update relevant implementation documents
- **Code Changes**: Update technical details when implementation changes
- **Architecture Changes**: Update architecture documents
- **Configuration Changes**: Update configuration documentation
- **Security Updates**: Update security implementation details

### Update Process:
1. **Identify Affected Documents**: Determine which technical implementation documents need updates
2. **Update Implementation Details**: Modify technical specifications without including large code blocks
3. **Reference File Names**: Include specific file names and locations for relevant code
4. **Add Small Snippets**: Include only necessary code snippets to explain concepts
5. **Update Status**: Mark what's implemented vs. planned
6. **Validate Against Code**: Ensure documentation matches actual implementation

### Document Maintenance Requirements:
- Updated when implementation changes
- Reviewed during code reviews
- Validated against actual code
- Maintained in sync with requirements
- Version controlled with code changes
- File references kept current
