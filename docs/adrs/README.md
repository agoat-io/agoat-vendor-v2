# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the AGoat Publisher database design and implementation.

## Overview

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of the system. They provide context for why certain decisions were made and help future developers understand the reasoning behind the current architecture.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:

- **Status**: Current status of the decision (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, etc.)
- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: The decision that was made
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative consequences of the decision
- **Implementation Details**: How the decision is implemented
- **References**: Links to relevant documentation and resources

## ADR List

### ADR 00001: Multitenancy Database Design for CockroachDB
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-31  
**Description**: Database design decisions for implementing multitenancy with CockroachDB

**Key Decisions**:
- Use UUID-based primary keys for even distribution
- Implement tenant-aware indexing for efficient queries
- Use logical partitioning through tenant context
- Optimize key design to avoid hotspots

**Rationale**:
- UUIDs distribute writes evenly across all nodes in CockroachDB
- Tenant-aware indexing provides fast query performance
- Logical partitioning allows flexibility while maintaining isolation
- Optimized key design prevents hotspots and ensures scalability

## Decision Process

### When to Create an ADR
Create an ADR when making decisions about:
- Database schema design
- Indexing strategies
- Performance optimizations
- Security implementations
- Scalability approaches
- Technology choices that affect the database

### ADR Lifecycle
1. **Proposed**: Initial proposal for a decision
2. **Under Review**: Decision is being reviewed by stakeholders
3. **Accepted**: Decision has been accepted and will be implemented
4. **Implemented**: Decision has been implemented in the system
5. **Deprecated**: Decision has been superseded by a newer decision

### Review Process
1. **Proposal**: Create ADR with proposed decision
2. **Review**: Stakeholders review and provide feedback
3. **Discussion**: Address concerns and refine the decision
4. **Approval**: Decision is approved by relevant stakeholders
5. **Implementation**: Decision is implemented in the system

## Best Practices

### Writing ADRs
1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what decision was made
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why the decision was necessary
3. **Document Rationale**: Explain why this option was chosen over others
4. **Consider Consequences**: Document both positive and negative consequences
5. **Include Implementation Details**: Provide enough detail for implementation

### Maintaining ADRs
1. **Keep Updated**: Update ADRs when decisions change
2. **Version Control**: Keep ADRs in version control
3. **Link to Code**: Link ADRs to relevant code and documentation
4. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review ADRs for relevance
5. **Archive Deprecated**: Archive ADRs that are no longer relevant

## Contributing

When contributing to the database design:

1. **Review Existing ADRs**: Understand previous decisions
2. **Create New ADRs**: Document new architectural decisions
3. **Update Existing ADRs**: Update when decisions change
4. **Link to Code**: Link ADRs to relevant code changes
5. **Follow Process**: Follow the established review process
