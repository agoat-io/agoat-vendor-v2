code that is relevant is for apps started in script 
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/local-scripts/start-full-stack-unified.sh

manage use cases and requirements under /Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories
maintain final resulting use cases, acceptance criteria and requirements under
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/final-functional
for functional requirements

and under 
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/final-nonfunctional
for non-functional requirements

and under
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/user-stories
for user stories

maintain a log of requirement changes with date and time summarizing change Request
under /Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/requirement-change-history

each change request should be in its own file with file name format YYYY-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss-requirement-request.md

requirements-and-user-stories folders should contain ONLY use cases and requirements:
- functional requirements: what the system shall do
- non-functional requirements: how well the system shall perform
- user stories: user-focused requirements in "As a... I want... So that..." format
- acceptance criteria: testable conditions for requirements

when you do any changes always update  technical implementation details, architecture, and design documents, use:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/technical-implementation
and explain what technical details are releveant in various md files there.
any time new features are added or changed then update technical implementation explanations
do not include large portions of code there, hust mention the file names in case one wants to see relevant code.
maybe small snipets of code if needed to understand something.

for analysis and research documents, use:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/analysis
for existing analysis documents

for architecture decision records, use:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/adrs
for existing ADRs

for API documentation, use:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/api
for existing API docs

for testing documentation, use:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/tools
for existing tool documentation

if specific environmental or other configuration requirements go in requirement folders, put them somewhere there, else choose a different folder

and the specific values choose some folder that makes sense

database schema and migration scripts are here 
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/app-api/migrations
any updates that result in database schema or initial data should also result in migration scripts
also in file named _current--full-schema.sql store sql to create latest schema from scratch

requirements templates are available at:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/templates
use these templates for consistent requirements documentation:
- functional-requirement-template.md: for functional requirements
- nonfunctional-requirement-template.md: for non-functional requirements  
- user-story-template.md: for user stories
-based on changes update ADRS in folder /Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/adrs
the final functional requirements, non functioal requirements and user stores and use cases should contain current state not a history of changes, other folders will includ requirement changes and code change history.

do not do playwright tests unless asked to explicitely, and if requested then:
- detect any javascript errors 
- ensure you read logs from server side apps to help troubleshot and fix any issues

always describe in files here /Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/code-change-history
all changes made to code what files in with what purpose
one file per change prepend with date yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-<change-title>.md

ensure the corresponding type of content is included for the file type.  One file by component type and update relevant dr content to code changes
include disaster recovery detailed steps here
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/disaster-recovery
