(node:7407) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/unified-app/postcss.config.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/unified-app/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
