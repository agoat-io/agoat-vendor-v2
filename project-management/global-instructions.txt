code that is relevant is for apps started in script 
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/local-scripts/start-full-stack-unified.sh

manage use cases and requirements under /Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories
maintain final resulting use cases, acceptance criteria and requirements under
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/final-functional
for functional requirements

and under 
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/final-nonfunctional
for non-functional requirements

and under
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/user-stories
for user stories

maintain a log of requirement changes with date and time summarizing change Request
under /Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/requirement-change-history

each change request should be in its own file with file name format YYYY-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss-requirement-request.md

requirements-and-user-stories folders should contain ONLY use cases and requirements:
- functional requirements: what the system shall do
- non-functional requirements: how well the system shall perform
- user stories: user-focused requirements in "As a... I want... So that..." format
- acceptance criteria: testable conditions for requirements

for technical implementation details, architecture, and design documents, use:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/technical-implementation
with subfolders for:
- authentication: authentication system implementation
- database: database schema and implementation
- features: feature implementation details
- api: API implementation details

for analysis and research documents, use:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/analysis
for existing analysis documents

for architecture decision records, use:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/adrs
for existing ADRs

for API documentation, use:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/api
for existing API docs

for testing documentation, use:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/tools
for existing tool documentation

if specific environmental or other configuration requirements go in requirement folders, put them somewhere there, else choose a different folder

and the specific values choose some folder that makes sense

database schema and migration scripts are here 
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/app-api/migrations
any updates that result in database schema or initial data should also result in migration scripts
also in file named _current--full-schema.sql store sql to create latest schema from scratch

requirements templates are available at:
/Users/andrewsmith/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/projects/agoat-publisher/docs/requirements-and-user-stories/templates
use these templates for consistent requirements documentation:
- functional-requirement-template.md: for functional requirements
- nonfunctional-requirement-template.md: for non-functional requirements  
- user-story-template.md: for user stories
