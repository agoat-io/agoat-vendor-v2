# Microfrontend Architecture Requirements

## Overview
The Microfrontend Architecture enables modular, independent deployment of UI components that can be composed together to create a unified user experience.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Module Federation
- **Runtime Loading**: Load components at runtime without build-time dependencies
- **Zero Knowledge**: Host application has no compile-time knowledge of remote components
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Discover and load remote components based on configuration
- **Version Management**: Handle multiple versions of shared dependencies

### 2. Component Isolation
- **Independent Development**: Teams can develop components independently
- **Technology Agnostic**: Support for different frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- **Styling Isolation**: Prevent CSS conflicts between components
- **State Management**: Isolated state management per component

### 3. Communication
- **Event System**: Inter-component communication via events
- **Shared State**: Controlled sharing of application state
- **API Integration**: Consistent API access across components
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of component failures

### 4. Deployment
- **Independent Deployment**: Deploy components without affecting others
- **Rollback Capability**: Rollback individual components
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitor component availability and performance
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across component instances

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Component load time < 1 second
- Bundle size optimization for each component
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Caching strategies for improved performance

### Reliability
- Fallback components when remotes are unavailable
- Retry mechanisms for failed component loads
- Circuit breaker pattern for dependency failures
- Health checks and monitoring

### Security
- Content Security Policy (CSP) compliance
- Secure communication between components
- Input validation and sanitization
- Access control for component loading

### Scalability
- Support for 100+ federated components
- Horizontal scaling of component instances
- Load distribution across multiple servers
- Efficient resource utilization

## User Experience Requirements

### Seamless Integration
- Components appear as native parts of the application
- Consistent styling and behavior across components
- Smooth transitions between component states
- No visible loading delays

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Clear error messages for users
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Fallback content for critical components

### Performance
- Fast initial page load
- Responsive interactions
- Minimal bundle size impact
- Efficient caching strategies

## Implementation Requirements

### Host Application
- Module Federation configuration
- Dynamic component loading
- Error boundary implementation
- State management integration

### Remote Components
